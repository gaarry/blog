<title>Chasing the Alpine Glow - gary</title>
<meta name="description" content="There&rsquo;s something magical about the way mountains catch the last light of day. Photographers call it &ldquo;alpine glow&rdquo; - that moment when the peaks are bathed in golden-orange light while the valleys below have already fallen into shadow.
I spent three days hiking to this viewpoint, camping along the way and waiting for perfect weather conditions. The forecast had predicted clear skies, and nature didn&rsquo;t disappoint.
The Perfect Moment
Mountain photography is all about patience. I arrived at this spot two hours before sunset to scout compositions and set up my equipment. As the sun began to dip toward the horizon, the light changed by the minute - from harsh daylight to soft golden hues, and finally to this dramatic orange glow on the peaks.">

        <p>There&rsquo;s something magical about the way mountains catch the last light of day. Photographers call it &ldquo;alpine glow&rdquo; - that moment when the peaks are bathed in golden-orange light while the valleys below have already fallen into shadow.</p>

<h2 id="the-perfect-moment">The Perfect Moment</h2>
<p>Mountain photography is all about patience. I arrived at this spot two hours before sunset to scout compositions and set up my equipment. As the sun began to dip toward the horizon, the light changed by the minute - from harsh daylight to soft golden hues, and finally to this dramatic orange glow on the peaks.</p>
<p>What makes this moment special is how fleeting it is. The alpine glow typically lasts only 5-10 minutes before the sun drops too low to illuminate the mountains. In those precious minutes, I worked quickly to capture different compositions.</p>
<h2 id="technical-notes">Technical Notes</h2>
<p>This image was shot with a Sony A7R IV and 24-70mm f/2.8 GM lens at 35mm. Settings: f/11, 1/30s, ISO 100.</p>
<p>I used a 3-stop graduated ND filter to balance the bright sky with the darker foreground, and a polarizing filter to reduce glare and enhance the colors. The image is a blend of two exposures - one for the sky and one for the foreground - to capture the full dynamic range of the scene.</p>
