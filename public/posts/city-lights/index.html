        <p>Hong Kong after dark is a photographer&rsquo;s dream. The city transforms into a canvas of light and color, with skyscrapers competing to outshine each other in a spectacular display that locals call the &ldquo;Symphony of Lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve visited Hong Kong many times, but I&rsquo;m always drawn back to capture its evolving skyline. This particular evening was special - the air was unusually clear after a passing storm, providing exceptional visibility.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-perfect-vantage-point">Finding the Perfect Vantage Point</h2>
<p>This shot was taken from Victoria Peak, the most famous viewpoint in Hong Kong. While it&rsquo;s a popular tourist spot, I arrived three hours before sunset to secure a prime location on the viewing platform. The wait was worth it.</p>
<p>As darkness fell, the city began its nightly transformation. One by one, buildings lit up until the entire harbor was aglow with thousands of lights. The reflection on the water adds another dimension to the scene, doubling the visual impact.</p>
<h2 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h2>
<p>Night cityscape photography presents unique challenges. This image is a blend of multiple exposures to capture both the bright lights and the darker elements without blowing out highlights or losing shadow detail.</p>
<p>Equipment: Canon EOS R5 with RF 15-35mm f/2.8L lens at 24mm
Settings: f/8, multiple exposures ranging from 1/15s to 4s, ISO 100
Support: Really Right Stuff tripod and ballhead (essential for sharp night images)</p>
<p>I also used a remote trigger to avoid camera shake and waited for moments when the wind was calm to ensure maximum sharpness in this long exposure shot.</p>
