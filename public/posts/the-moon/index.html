<title>The Moon - Gary Yao</title>
<meta name="description" content="There was a &ldquo;blood moon&rdquo; eclipse tonight. I&rsquo;ve never tried photographing the moon before – mostly because I didn&rsquo;t own a telephoto lens until recently. The photo below was captured at 840mm (1260mm FF-equivalent). It&rsquo;s crazy to think this giant rock is just chilling up there.
The lunar eclipse was visible from North America, and I was lucky enough to have clear skies in my area. I set up my camera on a tripod and used a remote shutter release to minimize camera shake.">

        <p>There was a &ldquo;blood moon&rdquo; eclipse tonight. I&rsquo;ve never tried photographing the moon before – mostly because I didn&rsquo;t own a telephoto lens until recently.

<p>The lunar eclipse was visible from North America, and I was lucky enough to have clear skies in my area. I set up my camera on a tripod and used a remote shutter release to minimize camera shake.</p>
<h2 id="camera-settings">Camera Settings</h2>
<p>For those interested in the technical details, here are the settings I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera: Sony A7III</li>
<li>Lens: Sony FE 200-600mm f/5.6-6.3 G OSS + 1.4x teleconverter</li>
<li>Focal Length: 600mm × 1.4 = 840mm (1260mm full-frame equivalent)</li>
<li>Aperture: f/9</li>
<li>Shutter Speed: 1/125s</li>
<li>ISO: 800</li>
</ul>
<p>I was surprised by how challenging it was to get a sharp image of the moon. Even with a sturdy tripod and remote shutter, the slightest vibration or atmospheric disturbance can affect the sharpness. I took about 50 photos and this was the sharpest one.</p>
