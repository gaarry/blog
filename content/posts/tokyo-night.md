Tokyo transforms into a completely different world after sunset. The city lights create a mesmerizing landscape that seems straight out of a sci-fi movie.

This photo was taken from Roppongi Hills, looking towards Tokyo Tower. The orange glow of the tower contrasts beautifully with the blue and white lights of the surrounding buildings.

## Photography Notes

Shot with Sony A7IV and 16-35mm f/2.8 lens at 24mm. Settings: f/4, 15s, ISO 100.

I used a tripod and remote shutter release to ensure maximum sharpness during the long exposure. The blue hour (about 20-30 minutes after sunset) provides the perfect balance between the darkening sky and the city lights.
