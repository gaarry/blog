One perk of living in Shonan is being able to see sunsets like this one.

The combination of Mt. Fuji's silhouette against the vibrant orange and red sky creates a truly breathtaking scene. On clear days like this, you can see the mountain perfectly from the coast.

## Photography Notes

This photo was taken with a Sony A7IV and 24-70mm f/2.8 lens at 55mm. Settings: f/8, 1/125s, ISO 100.

I used a graduated ND filter to balance the bright sky with the darker foreground, and waited for the sun to position itself just behind the mountain to create this dramatic effect.
