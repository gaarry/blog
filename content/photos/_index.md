Whenever I'm not working, I enjoy going out and taking photos. Here's a collection of my favorite shots from around the world - from urban cityscapes to remote mountain landscapes and wildlife encounters. Each image tells a story and captures a moment in time that was meaningful to me.

My recent trip to Xinjiang in April 2024 yielded some special moments, from the pastoral scenes on Nalati Grassland to the majestic snow-capped Tianshan Mountains in Xinyuan County, and the mesmerizing blue waters of Sayram Lake. The region's diverse landscapes offer an incredible canvas for photography, with dramatic contrasts between lush valleys, towering peaks, and crystal-clear alpine lakes.

If you happen to be in Beijing and want to meet up for coffee and a photographic adventure around the city, send me an email or reach out on X.
